This is a Game created for a class project called "Object-oriented programming" where I had to use design patterns and the principles of OOP in Java. 
The archive consists in the game itself, UML diagram, documentation and the database.
Half of the sprites used are made by myself and the other half are taken from internet.
The game has a 2d 3rd person perspective, being based on 3 levels where you have to beat different types of enemies and collect items(which may increse your health, speed or score based on drop chance) to gain enough score in order to get to the next level. After you defeat the biggest enemy, it will drop a key which allows you to open the cell where your pet(which had been kidnapped in the lore) is locked. Saving the pet displays the winning screen with your winning score saved into the database. The hero in the game defeats the enemies with fire projectiles that have a specified range of travelling afer being launched.
It is important to specify that the documentation in the archieve is written in romanian and you can find more information about the game in it. Also do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.
Enjoy! :)
